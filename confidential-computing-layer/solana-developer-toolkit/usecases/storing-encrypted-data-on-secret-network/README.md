# Storing Encrypted Data on Secret Network

Solana developers can now make use [SecretPath](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/confidential-computing-layer/ethereum-evm-developer-toolkit/basics/cross-chain-messaging/secretpath) to pass encrypted messages to a Secret Network smart contract.&#x20;

SecretPath seamlessly handles encrypted payloads, as the master gateway contract on Secret Network automatically decrypts payloads and passes the decrypted payload over to the target contract deployed on Secret Network.&#x20;

The encryption of the payload is done using the [ChaCha20-Poly1305](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChaCha20-Poly1305), an [authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated\_encryption) algorithm.

The key for this symmetric encryption is created by using the [Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve\_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman)(ECDH) scheme, comprising of two components:&#x20;

1. An extra encryption public key provided from the Secret Gateway Contract
2. A randomly created (ephemeral) encryption private key on the user side (independent of the user wallet's private key)

Combining both of these keys together via the ECDH Scheme yields our encryption key, which we use to encrypt the payload with ChaCha20-Poly1305.

Let's learn how to use SecretPath on Solana in the [key-value store developer tutorial](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/confidential-computing-layer/solana-developer-toolkit/usecases/storing-encrypted-data-on-secret-network/using-encrypted-payloads-for-vrf) ðŸ˜Š.&#x20;
