# SecretPath CCL SDK

[SecretPath](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/confidential-computing-layer/ethereum-evm-developer-toolkit/basics/cross-chain-messaging/secretpath) is a trustless bridge that allows EVM developers to use the privacy-preserving power of Secret smart contracts.&#x20;

Secret Network Foundation developed an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/secret-network-ccl) to simplify the developer experience, allowing **EVM encryption, verifiable randomness, and arbitrary execution/querying of Secret contracts** on [connected EVM chains](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/confidential-computing-layer/ethereum-evm-developer-toolkit/supported-networks/evm).&#x20;
