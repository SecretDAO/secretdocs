[SecretPath](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/confidential-computing-layer/ethereum-evm-developer-toolkit/basics/cross-chain-messaging/secretpath) connects Secret Network to [20+ EVM chains](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/confidential-computing-layer/ethereum-evm-developer-toolkit/supported-networks). With [WalletConnect](https://docs.walletconnect.com/), you can create a seamless user experience with one wallet login that **allows users to interact with Secret Network smart contracts on every SecretPath-connected chain.**&#x20;
