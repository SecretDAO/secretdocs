# IBC Relaying with Go Relayer

## Overview

The [Go relayer](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/hands-on-exercise/5-ibc-adv/1-go-relayer.html) is a relayer implementation written in Golang. It can create clients, connections, and channels, as well as relay packets and update and upgrade clients.&#x20;

In order to use Secret Network's IBC Developer Toolkit, you need an IBC transfer channel established between Secret Network and your Cosmos chain.&#x20;

In this section, you will learn:

* How to get started with the Go relayer.
* Basic Go relayer commands.
* How to create a transfer channel between Secret Network testnet and Neutron testnet.&#x20;

Let's get started! [ðŸš€](https://emojipedia.org/rocket)

## Installing Go Relayer

Clone the [Go relayer repository](https://github.com/cosmos/relayer):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cosmos/relayer.git
```

Build the Go relayer:

```bash
cd relayer
make install
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If you run into any errors during installation, you can install without `make` like so:
{% endhint %}

<pre class="language-bash"><code class="lang-bash"><strong>export GOBIN=$HOME/go/bin
</strong>mkdir -p $GOBIN

go clean -cache

go build -ldflags "-X github.com/cosmos/relayer/v2/cmd.Version=$(git describe --tags | sed 's/^v//') \
-X github.com/cosmos/relayer/v2/cmd.Commit=$(git log -1 --format='%H') \
-X github.com/cosmos/relayer/v2/cmd.Dirty=$(git status --porcelain | wc -l | xargs)" \
-o $GOBIN/rly main.go
</code></pre>

To check that the installation was successful, run:&#x20;

```bash
rly version
```

Which returns:&#x20;

```bash
version: 2.6.0-rc.1
commit: 3b9ec008999973469aeab4bbdbcb44ff4886b8b8
cosmos-sdk: v0.50.5
go: go1.23.4 darwin/arm64
```

## Configuring Go Relayer

The configuration data is added to the config file, stored at `$HOME/.relayer/config/config.yaml` by default.&#x20;

If this is the first time you run the relayer, first initialize the config with the following command:

```bash
rly config init
```

And check the config with:

```bash
rly config show
```

Now you are all set to add the chains and paths you want to relay on, add your keys and start relaying. You will set up two testnet chains: Neutron's `pion-1` and Secret Network's `pulsar-3`.&#x20;

### Add chain configs

The `rly chains add` command fetches chain metadata from the [chain registry](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry) and adds it to your config file:

```bash
rly chains add testnets/secretnetworktestnet
rly chains add testnets/neutrontestnet
```

{% hint style="info" %}
`rly chains add` will check the liveliness of the available RPC endpoints for that chain in the chain registry. The command may fail if none of these RPC endpoints are available. In this case, you will want to manually add the chain config.
{% endhint %}

### Create wallet keys

Create new keys for the relayer to use when signing and relaying transactions:

```bash
rly keys add secretnetworktestnet secret-test #this is the name of your key
rly keys add neutrontestnet neutron-test #this is the name of your key
```

Query your key balances:&#x20;

```bash
rly query balance secretnetworktestnet
rly query balance neutrontestnet
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You can fund your Secret Network testnet wallet [here](https://faucet.pulsar.scrttestnet.com/) and your Neutron testnet wallet [here](https://t.me/+SyhWrlnwfCw2NGM6) :tada:
{% endhint %}

Then, dit the relayer's `key` values in the config file to match the `key-name`s chosen above. The configuration data is added to the config file, stored at `$HOME/.relayer/config/config.yaml:`

```yaml
chains:
    neutrontestnet:
        type: cosmos
        value:
            key-directory: /Users/yourname/.relayer/keys/pion-1
            key: neutron-test
            chain-id: pion-1
            rpc-addr: https://rpc-lb-pion.ntrn.tech:443
            
     secretnetworktestnet:
        type: cosmos
        value:
            key-directory: /Users/yourname/.relayer/keys/pulsar-3
            key: secret-test
            chain-id: pulsar-3
            rpc-addr: https://rpc.pulsar.scrttestnet.com:443
```

### Configure path metadata in the config file

You configured the _chain_ metadata, now you need _path_ metadata.

There is one easy command to get this path information - from the [interchain folder](https://github.com/cosmos/relayer/tree/2.0.x/interchain) in the Go relayer repository:

```bash
rly paths fetch
```

Update your config file like so to use a configuration path that has been tested in production:

```yaml
global:
    debug-listen-addr: 127.0.0.1:5183
    metrics-listen-addr: 127.0.0.1:5184
    timeout: 10s
    memo: ""
    light-cache-size: 20
    log-level: info
    ics20-memo-limit: 0
    max-receiver-size: 150
chains:
    neutrontestnet:
        type: cosmos
        value:
            key-directory: /Users/<your-user-name>/.relayer/keys/pion-1
            key: neutron-test
            chain-id: pion-1
            rpc-addr: https://rpc-lb-pion.ntrn.tech:443
            backup-rpc-addrs: []
            account-prefix: neutron
            keyring-backend: test
            dynamic-gas-price: true
            gas-adjustment: 2

            min-gas-amount: 400000
            max-gas-amount: 500000
            debug: false
            timeout: 20s
            block-timeout: ""
            output-format: json
            sign-mode: direct
            extra-codecs: []
            coin-type: 118
            signing-algorithm: ""
            broadcast-mode: batch
            min-loop-duration: 0s
            extension-options: []
            feegrants: null
    secretnetworktestnet:
        type: cosmos
        value:
            key-directory: /Users/<your-user-name>/.relayer/keys/pulsar-3
            key: secret-test
            chain-id: pulsar-3
            rpc-addr: https://rpc.pulsar.scrttestnet.com:443
            backup-rpc-addrs:
                - https://rpc.testnet.secretsaturn.net:443
            account-prefix: secret
            keyring-backend: test
            dynamic-gas-price: false
            gas-adjustment: 1.2
            gas-prices: 0.1uscrt
            min-gas-amount: 400000
            max-gas-amount: 500000
            debug: false
            timeout: 20s
            block-timeout: ""
            output-format: json
            sign-mode: direct
            extra-codecs: []
            coin-type: 529
            signing-algorithm: ""
            broadcast-mode: batch
            min-loop-duration: 0s
            extension-options: []
            feegrants: null
paths:
    my_demo_path:
        src:
            chain-id: pulsar-3
            client-id: 07-tendermint-124
            connection-id: connection-100
        dst:
            chain-id: pion-1
            client-id: 07-tendermint-543
            connection-id: connection-466
        src-channel-filter:
            rule: ""
            channel-list: [channel-87, channel-1549]

```

Alternatively, you can also create your own path like so:&#x20;

```bash
rly paths new pulsar-3 pion-1 <your-path-name-here>
```

If you create your own path, be sure to add your transfer channels to the channel filters in the `config.yaml` like so:&#x20;

```yaml
src-channel-filter:
            rule: ""
            channel-list: [channel-87, channel-1549]
```

### Check Configuration Status

Before starting to relay and after making some changes to the config, you can check the status of the chains in the config:

```bash
rly chains list
```

Which returns this output when healthy:

```bash
0: pulsar-3          -> type(cosmos) key(âœ”) bal(âœ”) path(âœ”)
1: pion-1            -> type(cosmos) key(âœ”) bal(âœ”) path(âœ”)
```

And you can check the status of the paths in the config:

```bash
rly paths list
```

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
0: secretnetworktestnet-nuetrontestnet -> chns(âœ”) clnts(âœ”) conn(âœ”) (pulsar-3<>pion-1)
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}
In case one of the checks receives a `âœ˜` instead of `âœ”`, you will need to check if you completed all the previous steps correctly.
{% endhint %}

### Starting the Relayer

Finally, start the relayer on the desired path. The relayer will periodically update the clients and listen for IBC messages to relay:

```
rly start <your-path-name>
```

Congrats! You are now relaying between Secret Network testnet and Neutron testnet! :tada:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
2024-12-13T17:40:56.021378Z     info    Chain is in sync        {"chain_name": "neutrontestnet", "chain_id": "pion-1"}

```
{% endcode %}
