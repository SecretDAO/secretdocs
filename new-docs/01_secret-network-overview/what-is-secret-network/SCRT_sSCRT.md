## SCRT - The native coin of Secret Network
SCRT (commonly pronounced as ‚Äúsecret‚Äù) is  the native coin of  Secret Network. It is denoted by an ùïä enclosed within a circle, which symbolizes the programmable privacy feature offered by Secret Network. SCRT is similar to other coins such as BTC, ETH,as it is used as a gas fee to perform various interactions available on Secret Network. 
SCRT has a wide range of utilities on Secret Network including but not limited to; Payment of transactional and computational fees such as gas fees, staking with validators to secure the underlying network and earn inflation rewards, participation in community governance which helps to shape the future of the network and so on.
You can buy SCRT from Centralized exchanges (Binance, Kraken, Bitmart, Gate.io) and Decentralized exchanges(SecretSwap, Sienna, Osmosis), store it in your wallet(Keplr, Citadel.One, Ledger, Cosmostation), and use it anytime you want to interact with secret network. 

## SNIP-20 - Private tokens on Secret Network
Secret Network‚Äôs programmable privacy enables non-private tokens to be wrapped into their private and fungible equivalent through the Secret Network Improvement Proposals 2020 ( known as SNIP-20 standard), thereby providing complete confidentiality and anonymity through viewing keys via Secret contract. 
For example, SCRT can be wrapped into sSCRT(pronounced as secretSCRT) through SNIP-20 standard. Hence, sSCRT is a privacy-preserving and fungible equivalent of SCRT. Whenever you transact using a wrapped token such as sSCRT, the transaction remains private and nobody knows whether you send/receive sSCRT to/from whom. All native tokens like SHD, SEFI, ALTER, SIENNA are SNIP-20s and have privacy by default, all coins and tokens bridged from other networks like sATOM, sETH and sBNB are also private by default.

### Example of SNIP-20 privacy:
If wallet A sends 100 sSCRT to wallet B this will happen:
- Block explorer denotes that wallet A interacted with the sSCRT smart contract (It is not known whether this was a send, buy of NFT, viewing key etc. Amount of tokens is also unknown)
- Wallet B will NOT have an interaction listed on chain (aka on the block explorer)
- Wallet B can use their viewing key to decrypt the receiving transaction so will see the address of the sender and the amount they got.
