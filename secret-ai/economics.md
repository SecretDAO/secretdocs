# ðŸª™ Economics

Secret AI creates a sustainable economical model where users pay for Confidential AI Services using the [`SubscriptionManager` ](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/claive-ai/smart-contract-reference/subscriptionmanager)contract,  which in turn benefits the stakers of SCRT.&#x20;

### User Payments

Services may choose to accept payments in Fiat, Crypto or both. All Fiat payments will be converted into sSCRT or stablecoins (SILK, USDC), and deposited into the [`SubscriptionManager`](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/claive-ai/smart-contract-reference/subscriptionmanager) smart contract for the address of the user. Crypto payments can be sent direction to the [SubscriptionManager](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/claive-ai/smart-contract-reference/subscriptionmanager). Services can define subscription or pay-as-you-go models.

At the end of every Epoch (e.g. 7 days), user payments are distributed between the Workers in each service proportionally to the amount of work they performed, calculated as:

$$
W_i = Input Tokens Received + 4 * Output Tokens Served
$$

### Protocol Rewards

In order to stimulate supply of workers, especially in the initial period of the service, Secret stakers may decide to subsidize Workers by offering Secret AI Protocol Rewards.&#x20;

Protocol Rewards are distributed between Workers proportional to their uptime.

### Worker Staking

Workers are required to stake SCRT coins in oder to be part of the system. Exact mechanism of staking and slashing will be defined later.

### Protocol Fee

Secret Governance may decide to turn on a Protocol Fee that will be charged from the user payments to Workers. The Fee will be distributed between SCRT stakers.
