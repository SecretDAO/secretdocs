# RewardsManager

The `RewardsManager` contract is used to track and disperse rewards to Worker. Workers report the amount of work (e.g. number of input and output tokens) and the user payments are distributed between the workers' operators according to their share of work performed.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
`RewardsManager` is actively in development and is expected to be integrated in 2025.&#x20;
