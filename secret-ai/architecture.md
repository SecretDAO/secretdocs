# üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Secret AI is implemented as an off-chain Confidential Computing layer on top of Secret Network.

The Confidential Computing Layer consists of off-chain workers that utilize the NVIDIA Confidential Computing technology paired with Intel TDX and AMD SEV confidential VMs to perform AI tasks, such as inference, fine-tuning and training.

Secret AI supports multiple Services, with each Service offering a particular set of LLM models and functionality, pricing, access policy and more. Each Service can have multiple Confidential GPU workers that share the load of serving the users.&#x20;

To join the network, Workers register with the [`WorkerManager`](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/claive-ai/smart-contract-reference/workermanager) contract and perform attestation that is stored on-chain and available for any interested third party to validate the authenticity of the workers' hardware and software.

To access a Service, the users interact with the [`WorkerManager`](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/claive-ai/smart-contract-reference/workermanager) contract in order to get the address of the next available GPU worker, and establish direct connection with it. The Worker validates that the user has a valid subscription, and provides the required service.

Workers report the amount of work (e.g. number of input and output tokens) to the [`RewardsManager`](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/claive-ai/smart-contract-reference/rewardsmanager) contract, and the user payments are distributed between the workers' operators according to their share of work performed.&#x20;

The architecture also includes a decentralized and encrypted PRAG (Private RAG) database, that will allow users to share confidential data that can be later used for Retrieval-Augmented Generation on the participant LLMs. Use cases for such PRAG data may include medical data, private email archives, financial transaction data and more.
