## Secret Network v1.13 Instructions <a href="#secret-network-v1-13-upgrade-instructions" id="secret-network-v1-13-upgrade-instructions"></a>

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES ⚠️ <a href="#important-notes" id="important-notes"></a>

* All coordination efforts will be done in the "SN Validators" Telegram group.
* Make sure to [backup your validator](../maintaining-a-node-validator/validator-backup.md) before making any changes.
* **Please read carefully before you begin the upgrade.**

## Upgrading Manually <a href="#upgrading-manually" id="upgrading-manually"></a>

First, install all the needed system components. The requires the newer SGX driver, and the DCAP runtime.

```bash
# 1. Make sure the SGX driver is installed. The following devices should appear:
# /dev/sgx_enclave
# /dev/sgx_provision

# If your kernel version if 5.11 or higher, then you probably already have the SGX driver installed.
# Otherwise - please update the kernel version.

# Also make sure that the user under which the node is supposed to run has privileges to access SGX
sudo usermod -a -G sgx_prv $USER

# Logout and re-login may be needed, for the change to take effect

# 2. Install DCAP runtime
curl -fsSL https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx_repo/ubuntu/intel-sgx-deb.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx_repo/ubuntu focal main"
DCAP_VERSION=1.17.100.4-focal1
PSW_VERSION=2.20.100.4-focal1
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
    libsgx-aesm-launch-plugin=$PSW_VERSION \
    libsgx-enclave-common=$PSW_VERSION \
    libsgx-epid=$PSW_VERSION \
    libsgx-launch=$PSW_VERSION \
    libsgx-quote-ex=$PSW_VERSION \
    libsgx-uae-service=$PSW_VERSION \
    libsgx-qe3-logic=$DCAP_VERSION \
    libsgx-pce-logic=$DCAP_VERSION \
    libsgx-aesm-ecdsa-plugin=$PSW_VERSION \
    libsgx-aesm-pce-plugin=$PSW_VERSION \
    libsgx-dcap-ql=$DCAP_VERSION \
    libsgx-dcap-quote-verify=$DCAP_VERSION \
    libsgx-dcap-default-qpl=$DCAP_VERSION \
    libsgx-urts=$PSW_VERSION

sudo apt update
sudo apt install sgx-aesm-service libsgx-aesm-ecdsa-plugin libsgx-aesm-quote-ex-plugin libsgx-dcap-default-qpl
sudo apt upgrade

# 3. Configure AESM service
vi /etc/sgx_default_qcnl.conf
# setup the correct pccs
# ...

# Restart the AESM service
sudo systemctl restart aesmd.service

```

When the network reaches the halt height you'll see this message in your node's log (`journalctl -fu secret-node`):

```bash
2:00PM ERR UPGRADE "v1.13" NEEDED at height: ...
2:00PM ERR CONSENSUS FAILURE!!! err="UPGRADE \"v1.13\" NEEDED at height: ...
```

Then, follow those steps to upgrade for v1.13:
:warning: Note: The below instructions assume default installation. **DO NOT COPY-PASTE** if `config.toml` is not in `~/.secretd/config/config.toml` or if you modified `/etc/systemd/system/secret-node.service`. If you have modified `/etc/systemd/system/secret-node.service`, you will need to re-apply those changes post installation and pre service restart.


```bash
# Backup your node's SGX secrets
cp -a /opt/secret/.sgx_secrets ~/sgx_secrets_backup
mkdir 112backup
cp ~/.secretd/.node/* 112backup/


# Get the v1.13 binaries
wget "https://github.com/scrtlabs/SecretNetwork/releases/download/v1.13.0/secretnetwork_1.13.0_mainnet_goleveldb_amd64.deb"

# Stop the v1.12 node
sudo systemctl stop secret-node

# Install the v1.13 binaries
sudo apt install -y "./secretnetwork_1.13.0_mainnet_goleveldb_amd64.deb"

# re-apply any systemd unit file customizations


# Restart the node
sudo systemctl restart secret-node
```

After restarting the node with v1.13, you should see `INF applying upgrade "v1.13" at height: ...` in the logs (`journalctl -fu secret-node`). Once 67% of voting power comes online, you'll see blocks executing again.

## Upgrading Automatically Using Cosmovisor <a href="#upgrading-automatically-using-cosmovisor" id="upgrading-automatically-using-cosmovisor"></a>

Cosmovisor is a new process manager for cosmos blockchains. It can make low-downtime upgrades smoother, as validators don't have to manually upgrade binaries during the upgrade, and instead can pre-install new binaries, and Cosmovisor will automatically update them based on on-chain SoftwareUpgrade proposals.

⚠️ Cosmovisor is still new and best practices for using it are not yet established. If you don't feel adventurous at this time, we recommend [upgrading the manual way](v1.13.md#upgrading-manually).

For instructions on how to setup Cosmovisor, go [here](cosmovisor.md).

## Details of Upgrade Time <a href="#details-of-upgrade-time" id="details-of-upgrade-time"></a>

When the network reaches the halt height 11,136,666, the Secret Network blockchain will be halted and validators will need to take action to upgrade the chain to the secretd v1.13 binary (be it manually or automatically).

The proposal targets the upgrade proposal block to be 11,136,666, anticipated to be on Tuesday October 17, 2023 at 2:00 PM UTC.

The upgrade is anticipated to take approx 30 minutes, during which time, there will not be any on-chain activity on the network.

## In Case of an Upgrade Failure <a href="#in-case-of-an-upgrade-failure" id="in-case-of-an-upgrade-failure"></a>

In the event of an issue at upgrade time, we should coordinate via the "SN Validators" Telegram group.

If as a result of a software bug the network fails to produce new blocks with the v1.13 binaries, the SCRT Labs team will distribute a v1.12 binary with a replacement v1.13 upgrade handler, which will allow the chain to revert to v1.12 while continuing to produce new blocks.
