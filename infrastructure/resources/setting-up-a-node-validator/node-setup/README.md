# Mainnet Setup

This section will take you through the process of taking a node from fresh machine to full validator. The general steps are as follows:

1. [install-sgx.md](../testnet/install-sgx.md "mention")
2. [install-secretd.md](install-secretd.md "mention")
3. [setup-full-node.md](setup-full-node.md "mention")
4. [snapshot.md](snapshot.md "mention") or [state-sync.md](state-sync.md "mention") the node
5. [becoming-a-validator.md](becoming-a-validator.md "mention")

If you wish to create an archive node, replace step 3 with [Running an Archive Node](../../sentry-archive-and-ibc-node-setup/archive-nodes.md).
