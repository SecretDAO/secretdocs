# Install SGX (new DCAP)

Ensure your hardware is [hardware-compliance.md](../hardware-setup/hardware-compliance.md "mention").

If you're running a local machine and not a cloud-based VM -

1. Go to your BIOS menu
2. Enable SGX (Set to "YES", it's not enough to set it to "software controlled")
3. Disable Secure Boot
4. Disable Hyperthreading
