# How To Join Secret Network as a Full Node

This document details how to join the Secret Network `secret-4` mainnet as a full node. Once your full node is running, you can turn it into a validator in the optional last step.

## Requirements

- Ubuntu/Debian host (with ZFS or LVM to be able to add more storage easily)
- A public IP address
- Open ports `TCP 26656 & 26657` _Note: If you're behind a router or firewall then you'll need to port forward on the network device._
- Reading [Tendermint: Running in production](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/tendermint-core/running-in-production.html)
- RPC address of an already active node. You can use any node that exposes RPC services.
- Refer to [Intel Processor Specifications](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark.html#@Processors) if you're unsure if your processor supports SGX

### Minimum requirements

- 16GB RAM
- 256GB SDD
- 1 dedicated core of any Intel Skylake processor (Intel® 6th generation) or better (Xeon gen3 (Ice Lake) NOT supported)
- Motherboard with support for SGX in the BIOS

### Recommended requirements

- 32GB RAM
- 512GB SSD
- 2 dedicated cores of any Intel Skylake processor (Intel® 6th generation) or better (Xeon gen3 (Ice Lake) NOT supported)
- Motherboard with support for SGX in the BIOS

## Installation

### 0. Step up SGX on your local machine

See instructions for [setup](setup-sgx.md) and [verification](verify-sgx.md). See [registration](registration.md) if you'd like a more comprehensive overview on what's happening in these steps.

### 1. Download the Secret Network package installer for Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
wget https://github.com/scrtlabs/SecretNetwork/releases/download/v1.2.2/secretnetwork_v1.2.2_mainnet_amd64.deb
# check the hash of the downloaded binary
echo "1a51d3d9324979ef9a1f56023e458023488b4583bf4587abeed2d1f389aea947 secretnetwork_v1.2.2_mainnet_amd64.deb" | sha256sum --check
```

([How to verify releases](../verify-releases.md))

### 2. Install the package:

Note: if you are upgrading from v1.2.0, it may say secret-node is downgrading to version 0. Ignore it.

```bash
sudo dpkg -i secretnetwork_v1.2.2_mainnet_amd64.deb
```

Verify the installation by doing:

```bash
secretd version
```

### 3. Initialize your installation of the Secret Network.

Choose a **moniker** for yourself, and replace `<MONIKER>` with your moniker below.
This moniker will serve as your public nickname in the network.

```bash
secretd init <MONIKER> --chain-id secret-4
```

### 4. Download a copy of the Genesis Block file: `genesis.json`

```bash
wget -O ~/.secretd/config/genesis.json "https://github.com/scrtlabs/SecretNetwork/releases/download/v1.2.0/genesis.json"
```

### 5. Validate the checksum for the `genesis.json` file you have just downloaded in the previous step:

```bash
echo "759e1b6761c14fb448bf4b515ca297ab382855b20bae2af88a7bdd82eb1f44b9 $HOME/.secretd/config/genesis.json" | sha256sum --check
```

### 6. Validate that the `genesis.json` is a valid genesis file:

```bash
secretd validate-genesis
```

### 7. The rest of the commands should be run from the home folder (`/home/<your_username>`)

```bash
cd ~
```

### 8. Initialize secret enclave

You can choose between two ways, **8a (automatic)** or **8b (manual)**:

**Note:** if this machine has been registered before, and have the following files:

```bash
/home/user/.sgx_secrets/
├── consensus_seed.sealed
└── new_node_seed_exchange_keypair.sealed
```

you can move them to `/opt/secret/.sgx_secrets` and skip to **[step 16](#16-add-persistent-peers-to-your-configuration-file)** (if not working, try registering anyway).

### 8a. CURRENTLY BROKEN - SKIP TO 8b. Initialize secret enclave - Automatic Registration (EXPERIMENTAL)

- **Note:** Make sure SGX is running or this step might fail.

Make sure the directory `/opt/secret/.sgx_secrets` exists:

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/secret/.sgx_secrets
```

Create env variables:

```bash
export SCRT_ENCLAVE_DIR=/usr/lib
export SCRT_SGX_STORAGE=/opt/secret/.sgx_secrets
```

Register:

```bash
secretd auto-register --node http://bootstrap.node.scrtlabs.com:1317 --registration-node http://register.mainnet.enigma.co:26667
```

**If this step was successful, you can skip straight to [step 16](#16-add-persistent-peers-to-your-configuration-file)**

### 8b. Initialize secret enclave - Manual Registration (legacy)

Make sure the directory `/opt/secret/.sgx_secrets/` exists:

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/secret/.sgx_secrets/
```

Make sure SGX is running or this step might fail.

```bash
secretd init-enclave
```

### 9. Check that initialization was successful

Attestation certificate should have been created by the previous step

```bash
ls -lh /opt/secret/.sgx_secrets/attestation_cert.der
```

### 10. Check your certificate is valid

Should print your 64 character registration key if it was successful.

```bash
PUBLIC_KEY=$(secretd parse /opt/secret/.sgx_secrets/attestation_cert.der  2> /dev/null | cut -c 3-)
echo $PUBLIC_KEY
```

### 11. Config `secretcli`, to point to a working node and import a key with some SCRT

The steps using `secretcli` can be run on any machine, they don't need to be on the full node itself. We'll refer to the machine where you are using `secretcli` as the "CLI machine" below.

To run the steps with `secretcli` on another machine, [set up the CLI](../cli/install-cli.md) there.

Configure `secretcli`. Initially you'll be using the bootstrap node, as you'll need to connect to a running node and your own node is not running yet.

```bash
secretcli config chain-id secret-4
secretcli config node https://lcd-secret.scrtlabs.com:443/rpc
secretcli config output json
```

Set up a key. Make sure you back up the mnemonic and the keyring password.

```bash
secretcli keys add <key-alias>
```

This will output your address, a 45 character-string starting with `secret1...`. Then you can fund it with some SCRT.

### 12. Register your node on-chain

Run this step on the CLI machine. If you're using a different CLI machine than the full node, copy `/opt/secret/.sgx_secrets/attestation_cert.der` from the full node to the CLI machine.

```bash
secretcli tx register auth /opt/secret/.sgx_secrets/attestation_cert.der -y --from <key-alias>
```

### 13. Pull & check your node's encrypted seed from the network

Run this step on the CLI machine.

```bash
SEED=$(secretcli query register seed $PUBLIC_KEY | cut -c 3-)
echo $SEED
```

### 14. Get additional network parameters

Run this step on the CLI machine.

These are necessary to configure the node before it starts.

```bash
secretcli query register secret-network-params
ls -lh ./io-master-cert.der ./node-master-cert.der
```

If you're using a different CLI machine than the validator node, copy `node-master-cert.der` from the CLI machine to the validator node.

### 15. Configure your secret node

From here on, run commands on the full node again.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.secretd/.node
secretd configure-secret node-master-cert.der $SEED
```

### 16. Listen for incoming RPC requests so that light nodes can connect to you:

```bash
perl -i -pe 's/laddr = .+?26657"/laddr = "tcp:\/\/0.0.0.0:26657"/' ~/.secretd/config/config.toml
```

### 17. Enable `secret-node` as a system service:

Note that the `secret-node` system file is created in a previous step.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable secret-node
```

### 18. Start `secret-node` as a system service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start secret-node
```

### 19. If everything above worked correctly, the following command will show your node streaming blocks (this is for debugging purposes only, kill this command anytime with Ctrl-C):

```bash
journalctl -f -u secret-node
```

^C
```

You are now a full node. :tada:

### 20. Optimization

In order to be able to handle NFT minting and other Secret Contract-heavy operations, it's recommended to update your
SGX memory enclave cache:

```bash
sed -i.bak -e "s/^contract-memory-enclave-cache-size *=.*/contract-memory-enclave-cache-size = \"15\"/" ~/.secretd/config/app.toml
```

Also checkout this document by `[ block pane ]` for fine tuning your machine for better uptime: https://gist.github.com/blockpane/40bc6b64caa48fdaff3b0760acb51eaa

### 21. Get your node ID with:

```bash
secretd tendermint show-node-id
```

Be sure to point your CLI to your running node instead of the bootstrap node

```
secretcli config node tcp://localhost:26657
```

If someone wants to add you as a peer, have them add the above address to their `persistent_peers` in their `~/.secretd/config/config.toml`.

And if someone wants to use your node from their `secretcli` then have them run:

```bash
secretcli config chain-id secret-4
secretcli config output json
secretcli config node tcp://<your-public-ip>:26657
```

### 22. Optional: make your full node into a validator

To turn your full node into a validator, see [Joining Mainnet as a Validator](join-validator-mainnet.md).

### 23. Optional: State Sync

You can skip syncing from scratch or download a snapshot by [State Syncing](https://docs.scrt.network/node-guides/state-sync.html#mainnet-state-sync) to the current block.
