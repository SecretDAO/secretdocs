Secret Network offers verifiable on-chain random number generator for the entire Cosmos Ecosystem via IBC.

We have two methods available, depending on whether your chain supports IBC-hooks or not.

&#x20;Incase your chain supports IBC hooks, please take a look here: [secret-vrf-for-ibc-with-ibc-hooks.md](secret-vrf-for-ibc-with-ibc-hooks.md "mention")

Incase your chain does not support IBC hooks, please take a look at this [secretvrf-for-ibc-via-proxy-contracts.md](secretvrf-for-ibc-via-proxy-contracts.md "mention")here.
