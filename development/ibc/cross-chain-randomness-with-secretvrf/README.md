# Cross-Chain randomness with SecretVRF

Secret Network offers verifiable on-chain randomness for the entire Cosmos Ecosystem via IBC.

We have two methods available, depending on whether your chain supports IBC-hooks or not.

&#x20;In case your chain supports IBC hooks, please take a look here: [secret-vrf-for-ibc-with-ibc-hooks.md](secret-vrf-for-ibc-with-ibc-hooks.md "mention")

In case your chain does not support IBC hooks, please take a look here:[secretvrf-for-ibc-via-proxy-contracts.md](secretvrf-for-ibc-via-proxy-contracts.md "mention")
