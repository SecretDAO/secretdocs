# Ethereum (EVM) Developer Toolkit

## Privacy as a Service with Secret Network Contracts&#x20;

Secret Network contracts have ushered in a new era of confidential computing for EVM chains. We currently have 3 privacy solutions for EVM developers looking to bring privacy to their applications:

1. **Axelar General Message Passing (GMP):** Send cross-chain messages from an EVM chain to Secret Network and vice versa.
2. **EVM Shared Secret Cryptography:** Use Secret smart contracts to encrypt messages on any EVM chain with Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) cryptography.
3. **Snakepath:** On-chain randomness for the EVM.
