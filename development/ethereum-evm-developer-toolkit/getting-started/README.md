## EVM Toolkit - Getting Started&#x20;

Secret Network's EVM Toolkit is a new initiative to support the Ethereum community by creating a seamless inter-chain developer and end-user experience, enabling EVM developers to utilize Secret as a privacy-preserving L2 for Ethereum and the EVM ecosystem.

There are 3 components to the EVM toolkit:&#x20;

1. [**Axelar General Message Passing (GMP)**](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/development/ethereum-evm-developer-toolkit/axelar-gmp)**:** Axelar GMP allows developers building on Ethereum to execute smart contracts on Secret and vice versa. This means complete composability across Web3. This tutorial will teach you how to send `strings` from Polygon testnet to Secret testnet, with little to no Rust experience required. &#x20;
2. [**EVM "Shared Secret" Cryptography:**](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/development/ethereum-evm-developer-toolkit/evm-shared-secret-cryptography) EVM contracts are public by default. Learn how to encrypt data stored on EVM contracts that can only be decrypted with Secret Network smart contracts, and then take your developer skills to the next level with a [Private Voting developer tutorial](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/development/ethereum-evm-developer-toolkit/evm-shared-secret-cryptography/evm-confidential-voting) on the EVM. &#x20;
3. [**On-Chain Randomness Provider:** ](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/development/ethereum-evm-developer-toolkit/connecting-evm-with-snakepath-on-chain-rng)On-chain randomness for the EVM. Try out Snakepath RNG for an EVM developer solution that is cheaper and faster than ChainlinkRNG.&#x20;

Navigating the EVM Developer Toolkit will give you the tools to bring true on-chain privacy to your EVM contracts and decentralized applications. Should you have any questions or run into any issues, reach out on [Discord here](https://discord.gg/secret-network-360051864110235648) and someone from our developer community will respond shortly.&#x20;
