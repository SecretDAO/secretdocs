# Architecture Overview

## Axelar General Message Passing&#x20;

[Axelar](https://docs.axelar.dev/dev/intro) enables secure interchain communication and token transfers, spanning consensus methods including Cosmos and Ethereum. Through the use of General Message Passing (GMP), developers building on Ethereum can execute smart contracts on Secret and vice versa. This means complete composability across Web3.

With GMP you can:

* Call a contract on chain B from chain A.
* Call a contract on chain B from chain A and attach some tokens.
