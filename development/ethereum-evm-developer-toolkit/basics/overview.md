# Overview

Secret Network's EVM Toolkit is a cross-chain messaging and confidential computation SDK for EVM developers.&#x20;

The toolkit allows EVM developers to build novel cross-chain applications such as private DAO voting mechanisms, secure random number generation (Secret VRF), confidential data access control via EVM NFTs, encrypted DeFi order books, and more. &#x20;
