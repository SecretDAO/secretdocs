# Secret Toolkit

This Rust package is a collection of sub-packages that contain common tools used in development of [Secret Contracts](https://docs.scrt.network/dev/secret-contracts.html) running on the [Secret Network](https://scrt.network/).

While the packages in this repository are designed with Secret Network's runtime in mind, some of them may work well with the vanilla [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/) libraries and runtimes as well, or only require minimal modifications to be compatible with them.

See usage and docs at: [https://github.com/scrtlabs/secret-toolkit](https://github.com/scrtlabs/secret-toolkit)
