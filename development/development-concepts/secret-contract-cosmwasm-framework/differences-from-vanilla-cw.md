# CosmWasm vs Secret CosmWasm

### Cosmwasm and Secret

Secret Contracts are an implementation of the Rust-based library CosmWasm, while additionally enabling computation with private metadata. This brings unique use cases to Secret Network which arenâ€™t possible on other blockchains, and also means that **Secret Contracts have features that are different from standard CosmWasm contracts including: contract hashes, a specialized approach to iterators, raw queries, and contract migration.**&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
An in-depth analysis of [a smart contract](https://github.com/scrtlabs/crosschain-contract-demo/blob/old-std-name/src/contract.rs) that can be **deployed on a vanilla CosmWasm chain as well as Secret Network** can be found in our [cross-deployment tutorial.](../cross-deploy-vanilla-cw-and-secret-contracts.md)
{% endhint %}

### Contract Hashes

Contract hashes are required to bind a transaction to the specific contract being called. Otherwise, in a forked chain you could replace the called contract with one that decrypts and prints the input message.

### Iterator Feature

Secret contracts do not have access to standard CosmWasm iterators because keys and values of data are encrypted when stored on-chain. This means that there is no logical structure that can allow iteration over these keys. However, Secret Labs has developed iterator functionality that can be imported using the [Secret Toolkit storage package.](https://github.com/scrtlabs/secret-toolkit/tree/master/packages/storage)

### Raw Query

Raw queries are not available since raw data is encrypted when stored on-chain. Data can be decrypted only by the contract that owns the data, and so data is only available via permissioned contract queries (smart queries).

### CW-plus

CW-plus, a toolkit for CosmWasm contracts is largely supported but might not be optimal to use in all cases. Secret has its own Toolkit called [Secret-Toolkit](../../example-contracts/tools-and-libraries/smart-contract-tools-utils/secret-toolkit.md) that has the majority of CW-plus functionality. Alternatively one can alter small parts of CW-plus around the missing Iterator feature to leverage that library as well.
