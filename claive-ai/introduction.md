# ü§ù Introduction

In today's AI landscape, users and organizations share a huge amount of increasingly confidential and intimate information with providers of AI technology, without any solid guarantees of the information safety. Centralized AI providers are opaque and have strong incentives to utilize user data for their benefit. The emerging decentralized AI industry also lacks guarantees of data protection, and user data may become available to unknown and uncontrolled parties

Claive is a  Decentralized Confidential Computing solution that brings trusted AI to users who value their privacy. Built on the Secret Network, Claive leverages the NVIDIA Confidential Computing with Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) capabilities to provide fully confidential AI interactions. By addressing the critical issue of privacy in AI conversations, Claive aims to offer a secure, decentralized platform where users can engage with AI models without fear of data leakage or unauthorized access.

In addition to protecting the contents of user conversations, Claive also protects the metadata on AI usage - all the users‚Äô payments, access to specific models and worker earnings are recorded by Secret Network contracts and not accessible to outside viewers.

Claive is tightly integrated with Secret Network - it is governed by Smart Contracts running on Secret, uses SNIP-20 tokens for payments, and uses Secret Network's economic security.
